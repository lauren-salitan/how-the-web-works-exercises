How Web Works Exercise

Part One: Solidify Terminology
In your own terms, define the following terms:
* What is HTTP?
    HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and refers to how servers
    and browsers communicate. The 'protocol' aspect explains to rules followed
    for communication to take place.
* What is a URL?
    URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. A URL is the plain-english address
    to access a web resource (ie a website).
* What is DNS?
    DNS stands for Domain Name System. A DNS takes a name (like a URL) and 
    converts it to an IP address so that when a user goes to a url, they are 
    navigated to the website (the web resource behind the URL).
* What is a query string?
    A query string is the optional additions at the end of a URL that provides
    additional parameters.
* What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
    POST creates something, GET retrieves something(s)
* What is an HTTP request?
    An HTTP request (including POST, GET, etc.) is when a user asks a server to
    perform a task (one of the verbs).
* What is an HTTP response?
    An HTTP response is what the server delivers back to a user following a 
    request.
* What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers
you have seen.
    An HTTP header is where the context for a request is.
    Examples: accept-language, date
* What are the processes that happen when you type 
“http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
    Turns URL into IP address, browser makes requests, server responds to 
    requests, server sends status, browser pulls necessary contents.
